# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redeploy the application using the current codebase without any feature or behavior changes.

**Planned changes:**
- Trigger a new deployment using the current repository state.
- Verify the deployment completes successfully; if it fails, capture and provide the full deployment error output/logs.

**User-visible outcome:** The same application as before is available again via a fresh successful deployment (no UI/behavior changes).
