# Redeploy Marker

This file serves as a non-functional marker to trigger a fresh deployment of the application without modifying any UI or backend logic.

**Created:** February 13, 2026

## Purpose

This file was added to trigger a new deployment attempt after a previous deployment failure. No application behavior, UI, or backend logic has been changed.

## Deployment Troubleshooting

If this deployment fails again, please provide the following information for diagnosis:

1. **Full deployment error output/logs** from the deployment system
2. **Canister deployment status** (which canisters succeeded/failed)
3. **Build logs** showing any compilation or bundling errors
4. **Network/infrastructure errors** if deployment reached that stage

## Next Steps

- If deployment succeeds: This file can remain or be removed in a future update
- If deployment fails: Collect the error logs listed above and create a new change request with the specific error details for targeted troubleshooting
