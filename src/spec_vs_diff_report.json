  "summary": "The diff adds a new TingiWidget with Google Custom Search integration, localStorage-based configuration, and humor helpers, and wires the widget into App so it only renders after the password gate and welcome page are cleared. However, the required generated icon asset usage is not evidenced, and the humor generation appears non-deterministic (randomized) rather than deterministic templates.",

      "requirement": "Add generated static image assets for Tingi’s icon in frontend/public/assets/generated and use it for the floating launcher button with accessible alt/aria-label referencing “Tingi”.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any new image asset added under frontend/public/assets/generated for Tingi, and the added widget code (as truncated) does not provide evidence that an image icon is used for the launcher button (it imports lucide-react icons instead).",

      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Generate humor via deterministic templates combined with information extracted from Google results (no LLMs).",
      "reason": "The humor helper uses random selection (Math.random) for greetings/intros/endings, which makes responses non-deterministic across runs for the same inputs.",
