  "summary": "Website for collecting and displaying written memories of a friend named Rapunzel, with public visitor submissions (including optional image/video uploads), protected by a simple front-end username + 4-digit password gate (allowed usernames: tingi99 or meow99; code: 5699) and a welcome page after unlocking; welcome page includes a “Made for Tingi” subheading. Main experience includes a bottom-right floating “music box” widget where visitors can upload music files stored in the backend and played from a shared list; additionally includes a new post-unlock YouTube links page (opened via a floating button) where visitors can submit and view YouTube video/Short links with upload timestamps, and memories can be opened in a separate full-screen view with visible timestamps in the list. Memory access rules: users who unlock with username tingi99 can view all memories; users who unlock with username meow99 can only view and edit memories they themselves submitted (restriction applies only to memories list/full-screen memory view and memory editing). Add memory editing: only the original submitter can edit, with Edit actions available on both the memory card and the full-screen view, and edits record an edited timestamp.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Password protection requested is front-end only (not secure access control); it hides content in the UI until the correct 4-digit code is entered.",
    "Image selection should use standard browser file picker (<input type=\"file\">); browsers do not support deeper device-level storage permissions.",
    "Video uploads should use standard browser file picker (<input type=\"file\" accept=\"video/*\">) and store the selected video as a data URL; videos should not autoplay and should only play when the memory card is opened.",
    "Piddu bot replaces Tingi: bottom-right widget with a new UI look; simulated/deterministic responses only (no real LLM integration) and no Google Custom Search / no backend search or summarizing.",
    "Piddu/chat UI is removed and replaced by a bottom-right floating music-box widget that supports visitor music uploads.",
    "Visitor-uploaded music should be persisted in the backend (shared across visitors) and rendered in the widget as a simple list with play/pause controls.",
    "Password gate now requires a username + 4-digit code; username validation is front-end only and accepts either \"tingi99\" or \"meow99\" (username input displayed above the PIN input).",
    "Memory editing requires tracking/identifying the original submitter (no real auth); implement a submitter identifier and enforce edit permission so only the original submitter can edit.",
    "Support an edited timestamp on memories (e.g., editedAt) and display it in the UI when present.",
    "Add memory access control rules driven by the entered username (front-end only): tingi99 shows all memories; meow99 filters to only memories whose submitter identifier matches the current browser and only allows editing those."
